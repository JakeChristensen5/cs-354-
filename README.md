this repo contains projects and programs developed for the COMP SCI/E C E 354 - Machine Organization and Programming course @uw-madison. the projects demonstrate a deep understanding of fundamental structures of computer systems and the C programming language, with a focus on low-level interrelationships and performance impacts.

the projects include a virtual memory simulator, assembly language programs, C programming assignments, and a compiler design project. these projects showcase skills in dynamic memory management, memory hierarchy optimization, communication and interrupts, and compiler design principles. they provide a comprehensive understanding of machine organization and programming concepts, preparing me for more advanced topics in computer science and software engineering.
